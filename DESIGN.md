# DESIGN.md

## Source Of Truth

List any canonical design baseline files in `source_of_truth` frontmatter. Keep paths project-relative and markdown or text only.

## Visual Theme

Describe the product mood, density, and interaction style.

## Palette Roles

- `background`: base surfaces
- `foreground`: primary text
- `primary`: main action
- `secondary`: supporting action
- `muted`: quiet information
- `danger`: destructive action

## Typography

Define heading hierarchy, body text, labels, and numeric display rules.

## Component Guardrails

Describe buttons, inputs, tabs, cards, tables, dialogs, icons, focus states, and disabled states.

## Layout

Define spacing, grid, sidebar/header behavior, max widths, and dense versus relaxed surfaces.

## Depth

Define borders, shadows, elevation, overlays, and stacking behavior.

## Responsive Behavior

Describe mobile, tablet, desktop, and wide-screen constraints. Note text wrapping and overflow rules.

## Do And Don't

- Do preserve existing project design baselines.
- Do use semantic palette roles instead of ad hoc colors.
- Don't copy external brand examples into the product unless explicitly promoted.

## Agent Prompt Guidance

When an AI agent creates, verifies, or reviews UI, it should use this file as supplementary context. If a `source_of_truth` baseline is declared, use that baseline first and cite the selected path in findings.
